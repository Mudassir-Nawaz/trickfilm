  This classic piece of rolling stock will be familiar to anyone who rode the
  New York subway prior to 1988, when the last R-17 was retired from service.
  With train windows opaqued by full-car graffiti pieces and service
  announcements reduced to distorted gibberish, passengers, dislocated from
  real-world reference points, often had to guess at their whereabouts by
  animal intuition.


  Designed in [OnShape CAD](https://www.onshape.com/) from memory, reference
  photos, and original technical drawings, each car is completely one of a kind:
  hand-fabricated from archival 8-ply matte board and 3D-printed nylon, and
  uniquely hand painted. Working interior lights and display trestle are
  optional.
