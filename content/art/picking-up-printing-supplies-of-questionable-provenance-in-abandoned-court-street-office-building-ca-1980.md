I had an after-school job at a quick-print shop in Brooklyn Heights. My job duties included picking up batches of stolen printing supplies from the drop point, an abandoned upper floor of a sketchy Court St office building. Sometimes I went in the company of my counterpart, a black kid who worked for the Xerox place down the street, with whose Hasidic owners my boss, a hard-drinking Italian named [Frank](https://www.remsenprinting.com/about/), had a prickly competitive / collaborative relationship. “Hey kid, go down to the jews and borrow a case of paper.”
