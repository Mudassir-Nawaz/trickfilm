Among my many bizarre jobs, one of the most bizarre was a seriously down-on-its-luck scenery shop in Oakland. It was perhpas the greatest concentration of fire code violations ever assembled in a single building, which is a whole story of its own. What's relevant here is that the owner had launched a promotional campaign with the tagline "Memory is the best reminder." The more you think about it, the more meaningless it gets -- it's actually kind of brilliant in a way.
