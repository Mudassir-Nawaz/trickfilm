A sketch made during a trip to Huntsville, Texas in 2007, for a family wedding. Huntsville is home to a huge prison and it is where executions are carried out . A visit to the Texas Prison Museum, the death of KC & The Sunshine Band guitarist Jerome Smith in a bulldozer accident, and a general background note of Bush-era paranoia all contribute to the imagery.
