A sketch made during a 2007 trip to Huntsville, TX for a family wedding. Huntsville is home to a huge prison where the [majority of America's executions are carried out](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/states-with-the-most-executions). A visit to the Texas Prison Museum, the death of KC & The Sunshine Band guitarist [Jerome Smith](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/10/arts/jerome-smith-47-of-k-c-and-the-sunshine-band-the-hit-disco-group.html) in a bulldozer accident, and a general background note of Bush-era paranoia all contribute to the imagery.
