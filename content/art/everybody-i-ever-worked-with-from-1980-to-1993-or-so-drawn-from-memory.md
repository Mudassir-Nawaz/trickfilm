In my teenage years and 20's, I had a ton of jobs: office-assistant-gopher at a travel bureau and an ad agency; various quick-print and xerox shops; a whole bunch of offset lithography and pre-press shops; a couple of scenic construction companies and several animation studios; plus some others I'm probably forgetting.
Whenever I left one of these jobs, I'd draw the faces of my co-workers from memory.
I can remember stories and details about some of these folks; others are completely missing from my memory.
If you recognize yourself, let me know!
