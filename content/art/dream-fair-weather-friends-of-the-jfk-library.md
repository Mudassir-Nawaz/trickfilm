This is an oldie that I re-scanned and colored in Photoshop. One blustery day in the early 80s, Shoshana & I were walking around Columbia Point car-less and broke when we wandered into the newly opened JFK Library. The place was staffed by women who had clearly been avid JFK supporters in 1960 -- they were all wearing their vintage campaign buttons and talking about JFK like they were expecting him to show up any minute -- and a weird mood prevailed. We realized that it was November 22, the anniversary of JFK's assassination.
