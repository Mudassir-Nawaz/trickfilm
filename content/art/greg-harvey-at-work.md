A representation of one memorable day at the printing shop I worked at in SFO. Harvey was my boss and Greg was one of the pressmen. Greg was also a member of the Oakland Hell's Angels (in fact he'd left his home in the Midwest to ride with them, his local Angels chapter being insufficiently badass, I guess). Wherever Greg went, bizarre stuff happened. On this particular day, Greg popped his head into our room after having gotten into a knife fight at the deli across the street, blood cascading from his face. We called an ambulance (against Greg's protestations) and Harvey buried his face in his hands, trying to unsee the whole scene. 
In the deep background, a running figure is pursued by a guy wielding an axe. This also really happened, though on a different day.
