When I made this painting in 2001, a lot of excitement was in the air (much of it generated by Michael Chabon's [The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-amazing-adventures-of-kavalier-clay-michael-chabon/6723137?ean=9780812983586)) about what had been the secret history of Jews in the "Golden Age" of comics. Imagine my delight a year later when Marvel put The Thing in an [explicitly Jewish storyline](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Fantastic_Four_Vol_3_56).
