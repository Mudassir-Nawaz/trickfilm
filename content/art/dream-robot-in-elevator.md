I was in charge of transporting a fancy sex robot from Manhattan to Brooklyn, a difficult journey by train, bicycle and shopping cart, made more difficult by the robot's habit of spouting random facts whenever there was an awkward lull in conversation. This was supposed to be some kind of machine-learning algorithm for 'small talk', but it didn't work so well.
