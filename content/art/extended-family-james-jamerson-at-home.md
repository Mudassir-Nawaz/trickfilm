When I was 9 or 10, my mom took me to a survey of anamorphic art at the Brooklyn Museum. This exhibition spanned continents and centuries (from Holbein’s The Ambassadors to contemporary works) and it’s no exaggeration to say it blew my young mind permanently. Anamorphic and forced-perspective miniature environments have fascinated me ever since. Lately I’ve been designing and constructing them using CAD software, 3D printing, and laser cutting technologies.
