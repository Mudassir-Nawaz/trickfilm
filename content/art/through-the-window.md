You used to be able to look out the window of the Manhattan-bound D train as it crossed the bridge and see directly into a whole bunch of Chinatown sweatshops. Immigrant women sitting shoulder-to-shoulder behind rows of sewing machines. I believe it ran 24/7. Today this spot is probably 10 miles from the nearest factory.
