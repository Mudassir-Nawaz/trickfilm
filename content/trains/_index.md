subtitle: "Limited edition, handmade scale model of a vintage NYC Transit R-17"

This classic piece of rolling stock will be familiar to anyone who rode the New York subway prior to 1988, when the last R-17 was retired from service. With train windows opaqued by full-car graffiti pieces and service announcements reduced to distorted gibberish, passengers, dislocated from real-world reference points, often had to guess at their whereabouts by animal intuition.

Designed in OnShape CAD from memory, reference photos, and original technical drawings, each car is completely one of a kind: hand-fabricated from archival 8-ply matte board and 3D-printed nylon, and uniquely hand painted. Working interior lights and display trestle are optional.
