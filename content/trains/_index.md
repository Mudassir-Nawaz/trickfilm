 </br> <br>

This classic piece of rolling stock will be familiar to anyone who rode the New York subway prior to 1988, when the last R-17 was retired from service. 

With windows opaqued by full-car graffiti and announcements reduced to distorted gibberish, passengers, dislocated from real-world reference points, often had to guess at their whereabouts by animal intuition.

Designed from memory, reference photos, and original technical drawings, each car is completely one of a kind: hand-fabricated from archival 8-ply matte board and 3D-printed nylon, and uniquely hand painted. Working interior lights and display trestle are optional.
